            and `action_value` = 1 (enrolled) or -1 (unenrolled).

        Example:
            (edX/DemoX/Demo_Course, dummy_userid), (2013-09-10T00:01:05.123456, 1)

    def reducer(self, key, values):

        Calculate status for each user on the end of each day where they changed their status.

        Args:
            key:  (course_id, user_id) tuple
            values:  iterator of (timestamp, action_value) tuples

        Yields:
            (course_id, datestamp), enrollment_change

            where `datestamp` is in ISO format, with resolution to the day
            and `enrollment_change` is the change on that date for an individual user.
            Produced values are -1 or 1.

        No output is yielded if a user enrolls and then unenrolls (or unenrolls and
        then enrolls) on a given day.  Only days with a change at the end of the day
        when compared with the previous day are output.

        Note that we don't bother to actually output the user_id,
        since it's not needed downstream (though it might be sometimes useful
        for debugging).

        Also note that this can be greatly simplified if we have
        confidence that there are no duplicate enrollment events. Then
        we could just have the mapper generate output with the key as
        (course_id, user_id, datestamp), with a value of just the
        action.  Then the reducer just sums the actions for the date,
        and yields those days with non-zero values.

        Example output:
            (edX/DemoX/Demo_Course, 2013-09-10), 1
